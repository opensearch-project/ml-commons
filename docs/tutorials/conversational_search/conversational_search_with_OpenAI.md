# Topic

This tutorial explains how to use conversational search with OpenAI gpt-4o-mini model. For more information, see [Conversational search](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/search-plugins/conversational-search/).

Note: Replace the placeholders that start with `your_` with your own values.

The other way to build RAG/conversational search is using Agent Framework, see [RAG_with_conversational_flow_agent](../agent_framework/RAG_with_conversational_flow_agent.md)

## 1. Create connector and model

1. Create connector for OpenAI gpt-4o model:

Follow [this blueprint](https://github.com/opensearch-project/ml-commons/blob/2.x/docs/remote_inference_blueprints/open_ai_connector_chat_blueprint.md)

```
POST _plugins/_ml/connectors/_create
{
  "name": "OpenAI GPT-4o",
  "description": "Connector of OpenAI GPT-4o",
  "version": "1.0",
  "protocol": "http",
  "parameters": {
    "endpoint": "api.openai.com",
    "model": "gpt-4o"
  },
  "credential": {
    "openAI_key": "your_openai_key"
  },
  "actions": [
    {
      "action_type": "predict",
      "method": "POST",
      "url": "https://${parameters.endpoint}/v1/chat/completions",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer ${credential.openAI_key}"
      },
      "request_body": "{ \"model\": \"${parameters.model}\", \"messages\": ${parameters.messages} }"
    }
  ]
}
```

Note the connector ID; you will use it to create the model.

2. Create model:
```
POST /_plugins/_ml/models/_register?deploy=true
{
    "name": "OpenAI GPT-4o model",
    "function_name": "remote",
    "description": "OpenAI GPT-4o model",
    "connector_id": "your_connector_id"
}
```

Note the model ID; you will use it in the following steps.

3. Test the model:
```
POST /_plugins/_ml/models/your_model_id/_predict
{
  "parameters": {
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "system",
        "content": "You are a helpful assistant."
      },
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Who won the world series in 2020?"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
Sample response:
```

    {
      "output": [
        {
          "name": "response",
          "dataAsMap": {
            "id": "chatcmpl-A9Rtgkyk4PVlLil2u4JRUH2oXb25v",
            "object": "chat.completion",
            "created": 1.726815552E9,

                  "content": "The Los Angeles Dodgers won the World Series in 2020. They defeated the Tampa Bay Rays in six games to secure their first championship since 1988.",
                  "refusal": null
                },
                "logprobs": null,
                "finish_reason": "stop"

            "system_fingerprint": "fp_52a7f40b0b"
          }
        }
      ],
      "status_code": 200
    }
  ]
}
```

## 2. Conversational search

### 2.1 Create pipeline
```
PUT /_search/pipeline/my-conversation-search-pipeline-openai
{
  "response_processors": [
    {
      "retrieval_augmented_generation": {
        "tag": "Demo pipeline",
        "description": "Demo pipeline Using Cohere",
        "model_id": "your_model_id_created_in_step1",
        "context_field_list": [
          "text"
        ],
        "system_prompt": "You are a helpful assistant",
        "user_instructions": "Generate a concise and informative answer in less than 100 words for the given question"
      }
    }
  ]
}

```

### 2.2 Search
Conversational search has some extra parameters you specify in `generative_qa_parameters`:
```
GET /qa_demo/_search?search_pipeline=my-conversation-search-pipeline-openai
{
  "query": {
    "match": {
      "text": "What's the population increase of New York City from 2021 to 2023?"
    }
  },
  "size": 1,
  "_source": [
    "text"
  ],
  "ext": {
    "generative_qa_parameters": {
      "llm_model": "bedrock/claude",
      "llm_question": "What's the population increase of New York City from 2021 to 2023?",
      "context_size": 5,
      "timeout": 15
    }
  }
}
```

      "relation": "eq"
    },

        }
      }
    ]
  },

    "retrieval_augmented_generation": {
      "answer": "The population of New York City increased by 114,000 from 2021 to 2023, rising from 18,823,000 in 2021 to 18,937,000 in 2023."
    }
  }
