# Topic

This tutorial explains how to use conversational search with the Cohere Command model. For more information, see [Conversational search](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/search-plugins/conversational-search/).

Note: Replace the placeholders that start with `your_` with your own values.

The other way to build RAG/conversational search is using Agent Framework, see [RAG_with_conversational_flow_agent](../agent_framework/RAG_with_conversational_flow_agent.md)

## 1. Create connector and model

1. Create connector for Cohere Command model:

Limitation: Conversational search only supports [OpenAI](https://github.com/opensearch-project/ml-commons/blob/2.x/docs/remote_inference_blueprints/open_ai_connector_chat_blueprint.md) 
and [Bedrock Claude](https://github.com/opensearch-project/ml-commons/blob/2.x/docs/remote_inference_blueprints/bedrock_connector_anthropic_claude_blueprint.md) style of input/output.

This tutorial follows the Bedrock Claude model style of input/output by:
- Mapping the Cohere Command input parameter `message` to parameter `inputs` to match Cohere Claude model style.
- Using a post-processing function to transform Cohere Command model output to Claude model style.
```
POST _plugins/_ml/connectors/_create
{
    "name": "Cohere Chat Model",
    "description": "The connector to Cohere's public chat API",
    "version": "1",
    "protocol": "http",
    "credential": {
        "cohere_key": "your_cohere_api_key"
    },
    "parameters": {
        "model": "command"
    },
    "actions": [
        {
            "action_type": "predict",
            "method": "POST",
            "url": "https://api.cohere.ai/v1/chat",
            "headers": {
                "Authorization": "Bearer ${credential.cohere_key}",
                "Request-Source": "unspecified:opensearch"
            },
            "request_body": "{ \"message\": \"${parameters.inputs}\", \"model\": \"${parameters.model}\" }",
            "post_process_function": "\n    String escape(def input) { \n      if (input.contains(\"\\\\\")) {\n        input = input.replace(\"\\\\\", \"\\\\\\\\\");\n      }\n      if (input.contains(\"\\\"\")) {\n        input = input.replace(\"\\\"\", \"\\\\\\\"\");\n      }\n      if (input.contains('\r')) {\n        input = input = input.replace('\r', '\\\\r');\n      }\n      if (input.contains(\"\\\\t\")) {\n        input = input.replace(\"\\\\t\", \"\\\\\\\\\\\\t\");\n      }\n      if (input.contains('\n')) {\n        input = input.replace('\n', '\\\\n');\n      }\n      if (input.contains('\b')) {\n        input = input.replace('\b', '\\\\b');\n      }\n      if (input.contains('\f')) {\n        input = input.replace('\f', '\\\\f');\n      }\n      return input;\n    }\n    def name = 'response';\n    def result = params.text;\n    def json = '{ \"name\": \"' + name + '\",' +\n          '\"dataAsMap\": { \"completion\":  \"' + escape(result) +\n          '\"}}';\n    return json;\n   \n    "
        }
    ]
}
```

The `escape` function was added as a default function in 2.12, so you can use it in  the `post_process_function` directly:

```
"post_process_function": "    \n    def name = 'response';\n    def result = params.text;\n    def json = '{ \"name\": \"' + name + '\",' +\n                 '\"dataAsMap\": { \"completion\":  \"' + escape(result) +\n               '\"}}';\n    return json;"
```

Note the connector ID; you will use it to create the model.

2. Create model:
```
POST /_plugins/_ml/models/_register?deploy=true
{
    "name": "Cohere command model",
    "function_name": "remote",
    "description": "Cohere command model",
    "connector_id": "your_connector_id"
}
```

Note the model ID; you will use it in the following steps.

3. Test the model:
```
POST /_plugins/_ml/models/your_model_id/_predict
{
  "parameters": {
    "inputs": "What is the weather like in Seattle?"
  }
}
```
Sample response:
```
{
  "inference_results": [
    {
      "output": [
        {
          "name": "response",
          "dataAsMap": {
            "completion": """It is difficult to provide a comprehensive answer without a specific location or time frame in mind. 

As an AI language model, I have no access to real-time data or the ability to provide live weather reports. Instead, I can offer some general information about Seattle's weather, which is known for its mild, wet climate. 

Located in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States, Seattle experiences a maritime climate with cool, dry summers and mild, wet winters. While it is best known for its rainy days, Seattle's annual rainfall is actually less than New York City and Boston. 

Would you like me to provide more details on Seattle's weather?  Or, if you have a specific date or location in mind, I can try to retrieve real-time or historical weather information for you."""
          }
        }
      ],
      "status_code": 200
    }
  ]
}
```

## 2. Conversational search

### 2.1 Create pipeline
```
PUT /_search/pipeline/my-conversation-search-pipeline-cohere
{
  "response_processors": [
    {
      "retrieval_augmented_generation": {
        "tag": "Demo pipeline",
        "description": "Demo pipeline Using Cohere",
        "model_id": "your_model_id_created_in_step1",
        "context_field_list": [
          "text"
        ],
        "system_prompt": "You are a helpful assistant",
        "user_instructions": "Generate a concise and informative answer in less than 100 words for the given question"
      }
    }
  ]
}

```

### 2.2 Search
Conversational search has some extra parameters you specify in `generative_qa_parameters`:
```
GET /qa_demo/_search?search_pipeline=my-conversation-search-pipeline-cohere
{
  "query": {
    "match": {
      "text": "What's the population increase of New York City from 2021 to 2023?"
    }
  },
  "size": 1,
  "_source": [
    "text"
  ],
  "ext": {
    "generative_qa_parameters": {
      "llm_model": "bedrock/claude",
      "llm_question": "What's the population increase of New York City from 2021 to 2023?",
      "context_size": 5,
      "timeout": 15
    }
  }
}
```
