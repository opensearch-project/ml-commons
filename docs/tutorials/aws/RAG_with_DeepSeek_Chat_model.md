# Topic


This tutorial shows you how to implement retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) using Amazon OpenSearch and the [DeepSeek chat model](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/api/create-chat-completion).
If you are not using Amazon OpenSearch, you can use the DeepSeek connector chat blueprint directly. For more information, see [the blueprint](https://github.com/opensearch-project/ml-commons/blob/main/docs/remote_inference_blueprints/deepseek_connector_chat_blueprint.md).

For a simpler alternative, you can explore our Python-based implementation in this [demo notebook](DeepSeek_demo_notebook_for_RAG.ipynb).

Note: Replace the placeholders starting with the prefix `your_` with your own values.


# Steps

## 0. Preparation

### Obtain a DeepSeek API key

If you don't have a DeepSeek API key already, obtain one before starting this tutorial. 

### Create an OpenSearch cluster

Go to the AWS OpenSearch console UI and create an OpenSearch domain.

Note the domain ARN and URL; you'll use them in the following steps.

## 1. Create Secret
Store your DeepSeek API key in AWS Secret Manager.

When configuring settings, only change the values mentioned in this tutorial. Keep all other options at their default settings.

1. Open AWS Secret Manager.
1. Select **Store a new secret**.
1. Select **Other type of secret**.
1. Create a key-value pair with **my_deepseek_key** as key and your DeepSeek API key as value.
1. Name your secret `my_test_deepseek_secret` on the next page.

Note the secret ARN; you'll use it in the following steps.

## 2. Create an IAM role
To use the secret created in Step 1, you must create an IAM role with read permissions for the secret.
This IAM role will be configured in the connector and will allow the connector to read the secret.

Go to the AWS IAM console, create a new IAM role named `my_deepseek_secret_role`, and add the following policies:

- Custom trust policy:
```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "Service": "es.amazonaws.com"
            },
            "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
        }
    ]
}
```
- Permission:
```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Action": [
                "secretsmanager:GetSecretValue",
                "secretsmanager:DescribeSecret"
            ],
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Resource": "your_secret_arn_created_in_step1"
        }
    ]
}
```

Note the role ARN; you'll use it in the following steps.

## 3. Configure an IAM role in OpenSearch

### 3.1 Create an IAM role for signing the create connector request

Generate a new IAM role specifically for signing your create connector request.


Create an IAM role named `my_create_deepseek_connector_role` with the following policies:
- Custom trust policy:
```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": "your_iam_user_arn"
            },
            "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
        }
    ]
}
```
Note: `your_iam_user_arn` is the IAM user which will run `aws sts assume-role` in step 3.1.
- Permission:
```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "iam:PassRole",
            "Resource": "your_iam_role_arn_created_in_step2"
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "es:ESHttpPost",
            "Resource": "your_opensearch_domain_arn_created_in_step0"
        }
    ]
}
```

Note this role ARN; you'll use it in the following steps.

### 3.2 Map a backend role

1. Log in to OpenSearch Dashboards and select **Security** from the left navigation.
2. Select **Roles**, then select the **ml_full_access** role. 
3. On the **ml_full_access** role details page, select **Mapped users**, then select **Manage mapping**. Enter the IAM role ARN created in Step 3.1 in the backend roles.
4. Select **Map**. 
The IAM role will be successfully configured in your OpenSearch cluster.

## 4. Create a connector

For information about creating a connector, see [Connectors](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/ml-commons-plugin/remote-models/connectors/).


### 4.1 Get a temporary credential for the role created in step 2.1

Use the credential of the IAM user used in Step 3.1 to assume the role:

```
aws sts assume-role --role-arn your_iam_role_arn_created_in_step3.1 --role-session-name your_session_name
```

Copy the temporary credential from the response and configure it in `~/.aws/credentials` as follows:

```
[default]
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key_of_role_created_in_step2.1
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_key_of_role_created_in_step2.1
AWS_SESSION_TOKEN=your_session_token_of_role_created_in_step2.1
```

### 4.2 Create a connector

Add the DeepSeek API endpoint to trusted URLs:
```
PUT /_cluster/settings
{
    "persistent": {
        "plugins.ml_commons.trusted_connector_endpoints_regex": [
          "^https://api\\.deepseek\\.com/.*$"
        ]
    }
}
```

Run the following python code with the temporary credential configured in `~/.aws/credentials`:
 
```

import boto3
import requests 
from requests_aws4auth import AWS4Auth

host = 'your_amazon_opensearch_domain_endpoint_created_in_step0'
region = 'your_amazon_opensearch_domain_region'
service = 'es'

credentials = boto3.Session().get_credentials()
awsauth = AWS4Auth(credentials.access_key, credentials.secret_key, region, service, session_token=credentials.token)


path = '/_plugins/_ml/connectors/_create'
url = host + path

payload = {
  "name": "DeepSeek Chat",
  "description": "Test connector for DeepSeek Chat",
  "version": "1",
  "protocol": "http",
  "parameters": {
    "endpoint": "api.deepseek.com",
    "model": "deepseek-chat"
  },
  "credential": {
    "secretArn": "your_secret_arn_created_in_step1",
    "roleArn": "your_iam_role_arn_created_in_step2"
  },
  "actions": [
    {
      "action_type": "predict",
      "method": "POST",
      "url": "https://${parameters.endpoint}/v1/chat/completions",
      "headers": {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
        "Authorization": "Bearer ${credential.secretArn.my_deepseek_key}"
      },
      "request_body": "{ \"model\": \"${parameters.model}\", \"messages\": ${parameters.messages} }"
    }
  ]
}

headers = {"Content-Type": "application/json"}

r = requests.post(url, auth=awsauth, json=payload, headers=headers)
print(r.status_code)
print(r.text)
```
The script will output a connector ID:

```
{"connector_id":"duRJsZQBFSAM-WcznrIw"}
```

Note the connector ID; you'll use it in the next step.

## 4. Create and test a model

Log in to OpenSearch Dashboards, open the DevTools console, and run the following requests to create and test a model.

1. Create a model group:
```
POST /_plugins/_ml/model_groups/_register

    }
  ]
}
```

## 5. Configure RAG

### 5.1 Create a search pipeline
Create search pipeline with a [RAG processor](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/search-plugins/search-pipelines/rag-processor/):

```
PUT /_search/pipeline/my-conversation-search-pipeline-deepseek-chat
{
  "response_processors": [
    {
      "retrieval_augmented_generation": {
        "tag": "Demo pipeline",
        "description": "Demo pipeline Using DeepSeek Chat",
        "model_id": "VSlKsZQBts7fa6bypR02",
        "context_field_list": [
          "text"
        ],
        "system_prompt": "You are a helpful assistant.",
        "user_instructions": "Generate a concise and informative answer in less than 100 words for the given question"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
### 5.2 Create a vector database
Follow the [neural search tutorial](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/search-plugins/neural-search-tutorial/) to create an embedding model and a k-NN index. Then ingest data into the index:
```
POST _bulk
