# Topic


This tutorial shows you how to implement retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) in Amazon OpenSearch with the [DeepSeek R1 model](https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1).
If you are not using Amazon OpenSearch, you can use the DeepSeek connector chat blueprint directly. For more information, see [the blueprint](https://github.com/opensearch-project/ml-commons/blob/main/docs/remote_inference_blueprints/deepseek_connector_chat_blueprint.md).

For a simpler alternative, you can explore our Python-based implementation in this [demo notebook](DeepSeek_demo_notebook_for_RAG.ipynb).

Note: Replace the placeholders starting with the prefix `your_` with your own values.


# Steps

## 0. Preparation

### Deploy the DeepSeek R1 model to Amazon Sagemaker

Follow this [blog](https://community.aws/content/2sG84dNUCFzA9z4HdfqTI0tcvKP/deploying-deepseek-r1-on-amazon-sagemaker) to deploy the DeepSeek R1 model to Sagemaker.

Note the Sagemaker inference endpoint ARN and URL. They will be used in following steps.

### Create an OpenSearch Cluster

Go to the AWS OpenSearch console UI and create an OpenSearch domain.

Note the domain ARN and URL; you'll use them in the following steps.

## 1. Create an IAM role to invoke Sagemaker model
To invoke a Sagemaker model, you must create an IAM role with the appropriate permissions.
This IAM role will be configured in the connector. The connector will use this role to invoke the DeepSeek model deployed on Amazon Sagemaker.

Go to the AWS IAM console, create a new IAM role named `my_invoke_sagemaker_deepseek_model_role`, and add the following policies:

- Custom trust policy:
```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "Service": "es.amazonaws.com"
            },
            "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
        }
    ]
}
```
- Permission:
```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "sagemaker:InvokeEndpoint"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "your_sagemaker_model_inference_endpoint_arn"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

Note the role ARN; you'll use in the following steps.

## 2. Configure an IAM role in OpenSearch

### 2.1 Create an IAM role for signing the create connector request

Generate a new IAM role specifically for signing your create connector request.


Create an IAM role named `my_create_sagemaker_deepseek_connector_role` with the following policies: 
- Custom trust policy:

Note: `your_iam_user_arn` is the IAM user which will run `aws sts assume-role` in step 3.1
```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": "your_iam_user_arn"
            },
            "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
        }
    ]
}
```
- permission
```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "iam:PassRole",
            "Resource": "your_iam_role_arn_created_in_step1"
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "es:ESHttpPost",
            "Resource": "your_opensearch_domain_arn_created_in_step0"
        }
    ]
}
```

Note this role ARN; you'll use it in the following steps.

### 2.2 Map a backend role

1. Log in to OpenSearch Dashboards and select **Security** from the left navigation.
2. Select **Roles**, then select the **ml_full_access** role.
3. On the **ml_full_access** role details page, select **Mapped users**, then select **Manage mapping**. Enter the IAM role ARN created in Step 2.1 in the backend roles.
4. Select **Map**. 
The IAM role will be successfully configured in your OpenSearch cluster.

## 3. Create a Connector

For information about creating a connector, see [Connectors](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/ml-commons-plugin/remote-models/connectors/)


### 3.1 Get a temporary credential for the role created in step 2.1:

Use the credential of the IAM user used in Step 2.1 to assume role

```
aws sts assume-role --role-arn your_iam_role_arn_created_in_step2.1 --role-session-name your_session_name
```

Copy the temporary credential from the response and configure it in `~/.aws/credentials` as follows:

```
[default]
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key_of_role_created_in_step2.1
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_key_of_role_created_in_step2.1
AWS_SESSION_TOKEN=your_session_token_of_role_created_in_step2.1
```

### 3.2 Create a connector

Run the following python code with the temporary credential configured in `~/.aws/credentials`:
 
```

import boto3
import requests 
from requests_aws4auth import AWS4Auth

host = 'your_amazon_opensearch_domain_endpoint_created_in_step0'
region = 'your_amazon_opensearch_domain_region'
service = 'es'

credentials = boto3.Session().get_credentials()
awsauth = AWS4Auth(credentials.access_key, credentials.secret_key, region, service, session_token=credentials.token)


path = '/_plugins/_ml/connectors/_create'
url = host + path

payload = {
  "name": "DeepSeek R1 model connector",
  "description": "Connector for my Sagemaker DeepSeek model",
  "version": "1.0",
  "protocol": "aws_sigv4",
  "credential": {
    "roleArn": "your_iam_role_arn_created_in_step1"
  },
  "parameters": {
    "service_name": "sagemaker",
    "region": "your_sagemaker_model_region",
    "do_sample": true,
    "top_p": 0.9,
    "temperature": 0.7,
    "max_new_tokens": 512
  },
  "actions": [
    {
      "action_type": "PREDICT",
      "method": "POST",
      "url": "your_sagemaker_model_inference_endpoint",
      "headers": {
        "content-type": "application/json"
      },
      "request_body": "{ \"inputs\": \"${parameters.inputs}\", \"parameters\": {\"do_sample\": ${parameters.do_sample}, \"top_p\": ${parameters.top_p}, \"temperature\": ${parameters.temperature}, \"max_new_tokens\": ${parameters.max_new_tokens}} }",
      "post_process_function": "\n      if (params.result == null || params.result.length == 0) {\n        throw new Exception('No response available');\n      }\n      \n      def completion = params.result[0].generated_text;\n      return '{' +\n               '\"name\": \"response\",'+\n               '\"dataAsMap\": {' +\n                  '\"completion\":\"' + escape(completion) + '\"}' +\n             '}';\n    "
    }
  ]
}

headers = {"Content-Type": "application/json"}

r = requests.post(url, auth=awsauth, json=payload, headers=headers)
print(r.status_code)
print(r.text)
```
The script will output a connector ID:

```
{"connector_id":"HnS5sJQBVQUimUskjpFl"}
```

Note the connector ID; you'll use it in the next step.

## 4. Create and test a model

Log in to OpenSearch Dashboards, open the DevTools console, and run the following requests to create and test a model.

1. Create a model group
```
POST /_plugins/_ml/model_groups/_register
{
    "name": "Sagemaker DeepSeek model",
    "description": "Test model group for Sagemaker DeepSeek model"
}
```
The response contains the model group ID:
```
{
  "model_group_id": "H3S8sJQBVQUimUskW5Fm",
  "status": "CREATED"
}
```

2. Register the model

```
POST /_plugins/_ml/models/_register
{
  "name": "Sagemaker DeepSeek R1 model",
  "function_name": "remote",
  "description": "DeepSeek R1 model on Sagemaker",
  "model_group_id": "H3S8sJQBVQUimUskW5Fm",

{
  "parameters": {
    "inputs": "hello"
  }
}
```
The response contains inference results:
```
{
  "inference_results": [
    {
      "output": [
        {
          "name": "response",
          "dataAsMap": {
            "response": [
              {
                "generated_text": """hello<think>

              }
            ]
          }
        }
      ],
      "status_code": 200
    }
  ]
}
```

## 5. Configure RAG

### 5.1 Create a search pipeline
Create search pipeline with a [RAG processor](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/search-plugins/search-pipelines/rag-processor/).

```
PUT /_search/pipeline/my-conversation-search-pipeline-deepseek
{
  "response_processors": [
    {
      "retrieval_augmented_generation": {
        "tag": "Demo pipeline",
        "description": "Demo pipeline Using DeepSeek R1",
        "model_id": "Sym9sJQBts7fa6byEh1-",
        "context_field_list": [
          "text"
        ],
        "system_prompt": "You are a helpful assistant.",
        "user_instructions": "Generate a concise and informative answer in less than 100 words for the given question"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
### 5.2 create vector database
Follow the [neural search tutorial](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/search-plugins/neural-search-tutorial/) to create an embedding model and a k-NN index. Then ingest data into the index:
```
POST _bulk

```


### 5.3 Search the index
Run vector search to retrieve documents from the vector database, then use the DeepSeek model for RAG:
```
GET /my-nlp-index/_search?search_pipeline=my-conversation-search-pipeline-deepseek
{
  "query": {
    "neural": {
      "passage_embedding": {
        "query_text": "What's the population increase of New York City from 2021 to 2023? How is the trending comparing with Miami?",

How is the trending comparing with Miami\nAlright, let's tackle this question step by step. The user is asking for the population increase of New York City from 2021 to 2023 and how this trend compares to Miami's. 

First, I'll look through the search results to find the relevant data. From SEARCH RESULT 1, I see the populations for NYC in 2021, 2022, and 2023. In 2021, it was 18,823,000, and by 2023, it's 18,937,000. That's an increase of 114,000 over two years.

Next, I'll calculate the annual growth rates. From 2021 to 2022, the growth rate was 0.23%, and from 2022 to 2023, it's 0.37%. So, the trend shows an increase in the growth rate each year.

Now, looking at Miami in SEARCH RESULT 2, the population in 2021 was 6,167,000, and in 2023, it's 6,265,000. That's an increase of 98,000 over the same period. The growth rates were 0.74% in 2021-2022 and 0.8% in 2022-2023, also showing an increasing trend but at a higher rate than NYC.

Putting it all together, NYC's population increased by 114,000 with growth rates rising from 0.23% to 0.37%. Miami saw a slightly smaller increase of 98,000 but with higher growth rates, from 0.74% to 0.8%. So, Miami's growth is both higher in absolute terms and has a faster increasing rate compared to NYC.
