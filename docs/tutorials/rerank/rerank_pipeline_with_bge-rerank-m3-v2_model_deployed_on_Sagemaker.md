[Reranking pipeline](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/search-plugins/search-relevance/reranking-search-results/) is a feature released in OpenSearch 2.12.
It can rerank search results, providing a relevance score for each document in the search results with respect to the search query.
The relevance score is calculated by a cross-encoder model. 

This tutorial explains how to use the [Huggingface BAAI/bge-reranker-v2-m3](https://huggingface.co/BAAI/bge-reranker-v2-m3) model in a reranking pipeline. 

Note: Replace the placeholders that start with `your_` with your own values.

# Steps

## 0. Deploy the model on Amazon Sagemaker

Use the following code to deploy the model on Amazon Sagemaker. You can find all supported instance type and price on [Amazon Sagemaker Pricing document](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/pricing/). Suggest to use GPU for better performance. If the following code doesn't work, please refer [How to deploy this model using Amazon SageMaker](https://huggingface.co/BAAI/bge-reranker-v2-m3?sagemaker_deploy=true) on Huggingface.  

```python
import json
import sagemaker
import boto3
from sagemaker.huggingface import HuggingFaceModel, get_huggingface_llm_image_uri
from sagemaker.serverless import ServerlessInferenceConfig

try:
	role = sagemaker.get_execution_role()
except ValueError:
	iam = boto3.client('iam')
	role = iam.get_role(RoleName='sagemaker_execution_role')['Role']['Arn']

# Hub Model configuration. https://huggingface.co/models
hub = {
	'HF_MODEL_ID':'BAAI/bge-reranker-v2-m3'
}

# create Hugging Face Model Class
huggingface_model = HuggingFaceModel(
	image_uri=get_huggingface_llm_image_uri("huggingface-tei",version="1.2.3"),
	env=hub,
	role=role, 
)

# deploy model to SageMaker Inference
predictor = huggingface_model.deploy(
	initial_instance_count=1,
	instance_type="ml.g5.2xlarge",
  )
```

You can perform a reranking test with the following code.

```python
result = predictor.predict(data={
    "query":"What is the capital city of America?",
    "texts":[
        "Carson City is the capital city of the American state of Nevada.",
        "The Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands is a group of islands in the Pacific Ocean. Its capital is Saipan.",
        "Washington, D.C. (also known as simply Washington or D.C., and officially as the District of Columbia) is the capital of the United States. It is a federal district.",
        "Capital punishment (the death penalty) has existed in the United States since beforethe United States was a country. As of 2017, capital punishment is legal in 30 of the 50 states."
    ]
})

print(json.dumps(sorted(result, key=lambda x: x['index']), indent=2))
```

The reranking results are as follows:

```
[
  {
    "index": 0,
    "score": 0.013636836
  },
  {
    "index": 1,
    "score": 0.000593021
  },
  {
    "index": 2,
    "score": 0.92879725
  },
  {
    "index": 3,
    "score": 0.00012148176
  }
]
```

Note the model inference endpoint; you'll use it to create a connector in the next step. You can confirm the URL for the inference endpoint using the following code:

```python
region_name = boto3.Session().region_name
endpoint_name = predictor.endpoint_name
endpoint_url = f"https://runtime.sagemaker.{region_name}.amazonaws.com/endpoints/{endpoint_name}/invocations"
print(endpoint_url)
```

## 1. Create a connector and register the model

To create a connector for the model, send the following request. If you are using self-managed OpenSearch, supply your AWS credentials:
```json
POST /_plugins/_ml/connectors/_create
{
  "name": "Sagemakre cross-encoder model",
  "description": "Test connector for Sagemaker cross-encoder model",
  "version": 1,
  "protocol": "aws_sigv4",
  "credential": {
    "access_key": "your_access_key",
    "secret_key": "your_secret_key",
    "session_token": "your_session_token"
  },
  "parameters": {
    "region": "your_sagemaker_model_region_like_us-west-2",
    "service_name": "sagemaker"
  },
  "actions": [
    {
      "action_type": "predict",
      "method": "POST",
      "url": "your_sagemaker_model_inference_endpoint_created_in_last_step",
      "headers": {
        "content-type": "application/json"
      },
      "request_body": "{ \"query\": \"${parameters.query}\", \"texts\": ${parameters.texts} }",
      "pre_process_function": "\n    def query_text = params.query_text;\n    def text_docs = params.text_docs;\n    def textDocsBuilder = new StringBuilder('[');\n    for (int i=0; i<text_docs.length; i++) {\n      textDocsBuilder.append('\"');\n      textDocsBuilder.append(text_docs[i]);\n      textDocsBuilder.append('\"');\n      if (i<text_docs.length - 1) {\n        textDocsBuilder.append(',');\n      }\n    }\n    textDocsBuilder.append(']');\n    def parameters = '{ \"query\": \"' + query_text + '\",  \"texts\": ' + textDocsBuilder.toString() + ' }';\n    return  '{\"parameters\": ' + parameters + '}';\n",
      "post_process_function": "\n      \n      def dataType = \"FLOAT32\";\n      \n      \n      if (params.result == null)\n      {\n          return 'no result generated';\n          //return params.response;\n      }\n      def outputs = params.result;\n      \n      def sorted_outputs = outputs;\n      for (int i=0; i<outputs.length; i++) {\n        def idx = new BigDecimal(outputs[i].index.toString()).intValue();\n        sorted_outputs[idx] = outputs[i];\n      }\n      def resultBuilder = new StringBuilder('[');\n      for (int i=0; i<outputs.length; i++) {\n        resultBuilder.append(' {\"name\": \"similarity\", \"data_type\": \"FLOAT32\", \"shape\": [1],');\n        //resultBuilder.append('{\"name\": \"similarity\"}');\n        \n        resultBuilder.append('\"data\": [');\n        resultBuilder.append(outputs[i].score);\n        resultBuilder.append(']}');\n        if (i<outputs.length - 1) {\n          resultBuilder.append(',');\n        }\n      }\n      resultBuilder.append(']');\n      \n      return resultBuilder.toString();\n    "
    }
  ]
}
```

If you are using the AWS OpenSearch service, you can provide an IAM role ARN that allows access to the SageMaker model inference endpoint. For more information, see [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/ml-amazon-connector.html), [this tutorial](../aws/semantic_search_with_sagemaker_embedding_model.md), and [this connector helper notebook](../aws/AIConnectorHelper.ipynb):
```json
POST /_plugins/_ml/connectors/_create
{
  "name": "Sagemakre cross-encoder model",
  "description": "Test connector for Sagemaker cross-encoder model",
  "version": 1,
  "protocol": "aws_sigv4",
  "credential": {
    "roleArn": "your_role_arn_which_allows_access_to_sagemaker_model_inference_endpoint"
  },
  "parameters": {
    "region": "your_sagemkaer_model_region_like_us-west-2",
    "service_name": "sagemaker"
  },
  "actions": [
    {
      "action_type": "predict",
      "method": "POST",
      "url": "your_sagemaker_model_inference_endpoint_created_in_last_step",
      "headers": {
        "content-type": "application/json"
      },
      "request_body": "{ \"query\": \"${parameters.query}\", \"texts\": ${parameters.texts} }",
      "pre_process_function": "\n    def query_text = params.query_text;\n    def text_docs = params.text_docs;\n    def textDocsBuilder = new StringBuilder('[');\n    for (int i=0; i<text_docs.length; i++) {\n      textDocsBuilder.append('\"');\n      textDocsBuilder.append(text_docs[i]);\n      textDocsBuilder.append('\"');\n      if (i<text_docs.length - 1) {\n        textDocsBuilder.append(',');\n      }\n    }\n    textDocsBuilder.append(']');\n    def parameters = '{ \"query\": \"' + query_text + '\",  \"texts\": ' + textDocsBuilder.toString() + ' }';\n    return  '{\"parameters\": ' + parameters + '}';\n",
      "post_process_function": "\n      \n      def dataType = \"FLOAT32\";\n      \n      \n      if (params.result == null)\n      {\n          return 'no result generated';\n          //return params.response;\n      }\n      def outputs = params.result;\n      \n      def sorted_outputs = outputs;\n      for (int i=0; i<outputs.length; i++) {\n        def idx = new BigDecimal(outputs[i].index.toString()).intValue();\n        sorted_outputs[idx] = outputs[i];\n      }\n      def resultBuilder = new StringBuilder('[');\n      for (int i=0; i<outputs.length; i++) {\n        resultBuilder.append(' {\"name\": \"similarity\", \"data_type\": \"FLOAT32\", \"shape\": [1],');\n        //resultBuilder.append('{\"name\": \"similarity\"}');\n        \n        resultBuilder.append('\"data\": [');\n        resultBuilder.append(outputs[i].score);\n        resultBuilder.append(']}');\n        if (i<outputs.length - 1) {\n          resultBuilder.append(',');\n        }\n      }\n      resultBuilder.append(']');\n      \n      return resultBuilder.toString();\n    "
    }
  ]
}
```

Use the connector ID from the response to register and deploy the model:
```json
POST /_plugins/_ml/models/_register?deploy=true
{
    "name": "Sagemaker Cross-Encoder model",
    "function_name": "remote",
    "description": "test rerank model",
    "connector_id": "your_connector_id"
}
```
Note the model ID in the response; you'll use it in the following steps.

Test the model by using the Predict API:
```json
POST _plugins/_ml/models/your_model_id/_predict
{
  "parameters": {
    "query": "What is the capital city of America?",
    "texts": [
      "Carson City is the capital city of the American state of Nevada.",
      "The Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands is a group of islands in the Pacific Ocean. Its capital is Saipan.",
      "Washington, D.C. (also known as simply Washington or D.C., and officially as the District of Columbia) is the capital of the United States. It is a federal district.",
      "Capital punishment (the death penalty) has existed in the United States since beforethe United States was a country. As of 2017, capital punishment is legal in 30 of the 50 states."
    ]
  }
}
```

Each item in the `inputs` array comprises a `query_text` and a `text_docs` string, separated by a ` . `

Alternatively, you can test the model as follows:
```json
POST _plugins/_ml/_predict/text_similarity/your_model_id
{
  "query_text": "What is the capital city of America?",
  "text_docs": [
    "Carson City is the capital city of the American state of Nevada.",
    "The Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands is a group of islands in the Pacific Ocean. Its capital is Saipan.",
    "Washington, D.C. (also known as simply Washington or D.C., and officially as the District of Columbia) is the capital of the United States. It is a federal district.",
    "Capital punishment (the death penalty) has existed in the United States since beforethe United States was a country. As of 2017, capital punishment is legal in 30 of the 50 states."
  ]
}
```

The connector `pre_process_function` transforms the input into the format required by parameters shown previously.

By default, the SageMaker model output has the following format:
```json
[
  {
    "index": 0,
    "score": 0.013636836
  },
  {
    "index": 1,
    "score": 0.000593021
  },
  {
    "index": 2,
    "score": 0.92879725
  },
  {
    "index": 3,
    "score": 0.00012148176
  }
]
```

The connector `post_process_function` transforms the model's output into a format that the [Reranker processor](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/search-plugins/search-pipelines/rerank-processor/) can interpret. This adapted format is as follows:
```json
{
  "inference_results": [
    {
      "output": [
        {
          "name": "similarity",
          "data_type": "FLOAT32",
          "shape": [
            1
          ],
          "data": [
            0.013636836
          ]
        },
        {
          "name": "similarity",
          "data_type": "FLOAT32",
          "shape": [
            1
          ],
          "data": [
            0.013636836
          ]
        },
        {
          "name": "similarity",
          "data_type": "FLOAT32",
          "shape": [
            1
          ],
          "data": [
            0.92879725
          ]
        },
        {
          "name": "similarity",
          "data_type": "FLOAT32",
          "shape": [
            1
          ],
          "data": [
            0.00012148176
          ]
        }
      ],
      "status_code": 200
    }
  ]
}
```

Explanation of the response:
1. The response contains two `similarity` outputs. For each `similarity` output, the `data` array contains a relevance score of each document against the query.
2. The `similarity` outputs are provided in the order of the input documents; the first result of similarity pertains to the first document.

## 2. Reranking pipeline
### 2.1 Ingest test data
```json
POST _bulk
{ "index": { "_index": "my-test-data" } }
{ "passage_text" : "Carson City is the capital city of the American state of Nevada." }
{ "index": { "_index": "my-test-data" } }
{ "passage_text" : "The Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands is a group of islands in the Pacific Ocean. Its capital is Saipan." }
{ "index": { "_index": "my-test-data" } }
{ "passage_text" : "Washington, D.C. (also known as simply Washington or D.C., and officially as the District of Columbia) is the capital of the United States. It is a federal district." }
{ "index": { "_index": "my-test-data" } }
{ "passage_text" : "Capital punishment (the death penalty) has existed in the United States since beforethe United States was a country. As of 2017, capital punishment is legal in 30 of the 50 states." }

```
### 2.2 Create a reranking pipeline
```json
PUT /_search/pipeline/rerank_pipeline_sagemaker
{
    "description": "Pipeline for reranking with Sagemaker cross-encoder model",
    "response_processors": [
        {
            "rerank": {
                "ml_opensearch": {
                    "model_id": "your_model_id_created_in_step1"
                },
                "context": {
                    "document_fields": ["passage_text"]
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

Note: if you provide multiple filed names in `document_fields`, the values of all fields are first concatenated and then reranking is performed.

### 2.2 Test reranking

First, test the query without using the reranking pipeline:
```json
POST my-test-data/_search
{
  "query": {
    "match": {
      "passage_text": "What is the capital city of America?"
    }
  },
  "highlight": {
    "pre_tags": ["<strong>"],
    "post_tags": ["</strong>"],
    "fields": {"passage_text": {}}
  },
  "_source": false,
  "fields": ["passage_text"]
}
```

The first document in the response is `Carson City is the capital city of the American state of Nevada`, which is incorrect:
```json
{
  "took": 2,
  "timed_out": false,
  "_shards": {
    "total": 1,
    "successful": 1,
    "skipped": 0,
    "failed": 0
  },
  "hits": {
    "total": {
      "value": 4,
      "relation": "eq"
    },
    "max_score": 2.5045562,
    "hits": [
      {
        "_index": "my-test-data",
        "_id": "1",
        "_score": 2.5045562,
        "fields": {
          "passage_text": [
            "Carson City is the capital city of the American state of Nevada."
          ]
        },
        "highlight": {
          "passage_text": [
            "Carson <strong>City</strong> <strong>is</strong> <strong>the</strong> <strong>capital</strong> <strong>city</strong> <strong>of</strong> <strong>the</strong> American state <strong>of</strong> Nevada."
          ]
        }
      },
      {
        "_index": "my-test-data",
        "_id": "2",
        "_score": 0.5807494,
        "fields": {
          "passage_text": [
            "The Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands is a group of islands in the Pacific Ocean. Its capital is Saipan."
          ]
        },
        "highlight": {
          "passage_text": [
            "<strong>The</strong> Commonwealth <strong>of</strong> <strong>the</strong> Northern Mariana Islands <strong>is</strong> a group <strong>of</strong> islands in <strong>the</strong> Pacific Ocean.",
            "Its <strong>capital</strong> <strong>is</strong> Saipan."
          ]
        }
      },
      {
        "_index": "my-test-data",
        "_id": "3",
        "_score": 0.5261191,
        "fields": {
          "passage_text": [
            "Washington, D.C. (also known as simply Washington or D.C., and officially as the District of Columbia) is the capital of the United States. It is a federal district."
          ]
        },
        "highlight": {
          "passage_text": [
            "(also known as simply Washington or D.C., and officially as <strong>the</strong> District <strong>of</strong> Columbia) <strong>is</strong> <strong>the</strong> <strong>capital</strong>",
            "<strong>of</strong> <strong>the</strong> United States.",
            "It <strong>is</strong> a federal district."
          ]
        }
      },
      {
        "_index": "my-test-data",
        "_id": "4",
        "_score": 0.5083029,
        "fields": {
          "passage_text": [
            "Capital punishment (the death penalty) has existed in the United States since beforethe United States was a country. As of 2017, capital punishment is legal in 30 of the 50 states."
          ]
        },
        "highlight": {
          "passage_text": [
            "<strong>Capital</strong> punishment (<strong>the</strong> death penalty) has existed in <strong>the</strong> United States since beforethe United States",
            "As <strong>of</strong> 2017, <strong>capital</strong> punishment <strong>is</strong> legal in 30 <strong>of</strong> <strong>the</strong> 50 states."
          ]
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Next, test the query using the reranking pipeline:
```json
POST my-test-data/_search?search_pipeline=rerank_pipeline_sagemaker
{
  "query": {
    "match": {
      "passage_text": "What is the capital city of America?"
    }
  },
  "ext": {
    "rerank": {
      "query_context": {
         "query_text": "What is the capital city of America?"
      }
    }
  },
  "highlight": {
    "pre_tags": ["<strong>"],
    "post_tags": ["</strong>"],
    "fields": {"passage_text": {}}
  },
  "_source": false,
  "fields": ["passage_text"]
}
```

The first document in the response is `"Washington, D.C. (also known as simply Washington or D.C., and officially as the District of Columbia) is the capital of the United States. It is a federal district."`, which is correct:

```json
{
  "took": 2,
  "timed_out": false,
  "_shards": {
    "total": 1,
    "successful": 1,
    "skipped": 0,
    "failed": 0
  },
  "hits": {
    "total": {
      "value": 4,
      "relation": "eq"
    },
    "max_score": 0.92879725,
    "hits": [
      {
        "_index": "my-test-data",
        "_id": "3",
        "_score": 0.92879725,
        "fields": {
          "passage_text": [
            "Washington, D.C. (also known as simply Washington or D.C., and officially as the District of Columbia) is the capital of the United States. It is a federal district."
          ]
        },
        "highlight": {
          "passage_text": [
            "(also known as simply Washington or D.C., and officially as <strong>the</strong> District <strong>of</strong> Columbia) <strong>is</strong> <strong>the</strong> <strong>capital</strong>",
            "<strong>of</strong> <strong>the</strong> United States.",
            "It <strong>is</strong> a federal district."
          ]
        }

Note: You can avoid writing the query twice by using query_text_path instead of query_text, as follows:
```json
POST my-test-data/_search?search_pipeline=rerank_pipeline_sagemaker
{
  "query": {
    "match": {
      "passage_text": "What is the capital city of America?"
    }
  },
  "ext": {
    "rerank": {
      "query_context": {
