> Agent Framework is GA released in OpenSearch 2.13. To read more details, see the OpenSearch document [Agents and tools](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/ml-commons-plugin/agents-tools/index/).

Some questions require more than one call to an LLM to produce an answer. For example, an LLM can't answer how many errors there are in your log index for last week because its knowledge base does not contain your proprietary data.
You can use an agent to solve such complex problems. The agent can run tools to obtain more information and send it to the LLM as context.

The OpenSearch 2.12 release includes three types of agents (all experimental):
1. `flow`: Runs tools sequentially, in the order specified in its configuration. The workflow of a flow agent is fixed. It doesn't store chat messages.
2. `conversational_flow`: Runs tools sequentially, in the order specified in its configuration. The workflow of a flow agent is fixed. Stores message history so that users can ask follow-up questions.
3. `conversational`: Sends questions to an LLM. The LLM reasons iteratively to decide what action to take, until it obtains the final answer or reaches the iteration limit. 

This tutorial demonstrates how to build your own chatbot in OpenSearch using a `conversational` agent.

Note: Replace the placeholders starting with the prefix `your_` with your own values.

# Steps
## 0. preparation

Log in to the OpenSearch Dashboards homepage, select **Add sample data**, then add **Sample eCommerce orders** data.

## 1. Set up knowledge base

Follow step 0 and step 1 of [RAG_with_conversational_flow_agent](./RAG_with_conversational_flow_agent.md) to set up
the `test_population_data` knowledge base index, which contains US city population data.


Create an ingest pipeline:
```
PUT /_ingest/pipeline/test_stock_price_data_pipeline
{
    "description": "text embedding pipeline",
    "processors": [
        {
            "text_embedding": {
                "model_id": "your_text_embedding_model_id",
                "field_map": {
                    "stock_price_history": "stock_price_history_embedding"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```
Create the `test_stock_price_data` index, which contains historical stock price data:
```
PUT test_stock_price_data
{
  "mappings": {
    "properties": {
      "stock_price_history": {
        "type": "text"
      },
      "stock_price_history_embedding": {
        "type": "knn_vector",
        "dimension": 384
      }
    }
  },
  "settings": {
    "index": {
      "knn.space_type": "cosinesimil",
      "default_pipeline": "test_stock_price_data_pipeline",
      "knn": "true"
    }
  }
}
```
Ingest data:
```

## 2. Create LLM

For more information, see [Remote models](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/ml-commons-plugin/remote-models/index/).

This tutorial uses the [Bedrock Claude model](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/claude/). You can also use other LLMs.

1. Create a connector:
```
POST /_plugins/_ml/connectors/_create
{
  "name": "BedRock Claude instant-v1 Connector ",
  "description": "The connector to BedRock service for claude model",
  "version": 1,
  "protocol": "aws_sigv4",
  "parameters": {
    "region": "us-east-1",
    "service_name": "bedrock",
    "anthropic_version": "bedrock-2023-05-31",
    "max_tokens_to_sample": 8000,
    "temperature": 0.0001,
    "response_filter": "$.completion",
    "stop_sequences": ["\n\nHuman:","\nObservation:","\n\tObservation:","\nObservation","\n\tObservation","\n\nQuestion"]
  },
  "credential": {
    "access_key": "your_aws_access_key",
    "secret_key": "your_aws_secret_key",
    "session_token": "your_aws_session_token"
  },
  "actions": [
    {
      "action_type": "predict",
      "method": "POST",
      "url": "https://bedrock-runtime.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/model/anthropic.claude-instant-v1/invoke",
      "headers": {
        "content-type": "application/json",
        "x-amz-content-sha256": "required"
      },
      "request_body": "{\"prompt\":\"${parameters.prompt}\", \"stop_sequences\": ${parameters.stop_sequences}, \"max_tokens_to_sample\":${parameters.max_tokens_to_sample}, \"temperature\":${parameters.temperature},  \"anthropic_version\":\"${parameters.anthropic_version}\" }"
    }
  ]
}
```

Note the connector ID; you'll use it to register the model.

2. Register the model:

```
POST /_plugins/_ml/models/_register
{
    "name": "Bedrock Claude Instant model",
    "function_name": "remote",
    "description": "Bedrock Claude instant-v1 model",
    "connector_id": "your_connector_id"
}
```
Note the LLM model id from the response; you will use it to create agent.

3. Deploy the model:
```
POST /_plugins/_ml/models/your_LLM_model_id/_deploy
```

4. Test the model:
```
POST /_plugins/_ml/models/your_LLM_model_id/_predict
{
  "parameters": {
    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: how are you? \n\nAssistant:"
  }
}
```


## 3. Agent with default prompt

### 3.1 Create agent

Create an agent of the `conversational` type. 

The agent is configured with the following information:
1. Meta info: `name`, `type`, `description`
2. LLM: The agent uses an LLM to reason and select the next step, including choosing an appropriate tool and preparing the tool input.
3. Tools: A tool is a function that can be executed by the agent. Each tool can define its own `name`, `description` and `parameters`.
4. Memory: Stores chat messages. OpenSearch 2.12 only supports one memory type: `conversation_index`.


Explanation of key parameters:
1. `conversational`: This agent type has a built-in prompt. To override it with your own prompt, see step 4.
2. `app_type`: This is for reference purposes, so you can differentiate between multiple agents.
3. `llm`: Defines the LLM configuration.
   1. `"max_iteration": 5`:  The agent runs the LLM a maximum of 5 times.
   2. `"response_filter": "$.completion"` is to retrieve the LLM answer from the Bedrock Claude model response.
   3. `"message_history_limit": 5`: Agent retrieves a maximum of 5 most recent history messages and adds them to the LLM context. Set to`0` to omit message history in the context.
   4. `disable_trace`: If `true`, the agent does not store trace data in memory. Trace data is included in each message and provides detailed steps performed while generating the message.
4. `memory`: Defines how to store messages. OpenSearch 2.12 only supports the `conversation_index` memory, which stores messages in a memory index.
5. Tools: This tutorial doesn't explain each tool's details. For more information, see the [Tools documentation](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/ml-commons-plugin/agents-tools/tools/index/). Note the following information:
   1. An LLM will reason to decide which tool to run and will prepare the tool's input. 
   2. To include the tool's output in the response, specify `"include_output_in_agent_response": true`. In this tutorial, you will include the `PPLTool` output in the response (see the sample response in step 3.2). 
   3. By default, the tool's `name` is the same as the tool's `type`, and each tool has its default description. You can override the tool's `name` and `description`.
   4. Each tool in the `tools` list must have a unique name. For example, the demo agent below defines two tools of the `VectorDBTool` type with different
names (`population_data_knowledge_base` and `stock_price_data_knowledge_base`). Each tool has a custom description so the LLM can easily understand what the tool does.

Note: You don't need to configure all of these tools in your agent. You can simply configure those that are relevant to your use case.

### 3.2 Test agent

Tips: 
1. You can view the detailed steps of an agent execution in one of the following ways:
   1. Enabling verbose mode : `"verbose": true`
   2. Calling the Get Trace API: `GET _plugins/_ml/memory/message/your_message_id/traces`

2. An LLM may sometimes hallucinate. It may choose a wrong tool to solve your problem, especially when you configured many tools. You can use these options to avoid hallucinations:
   1. Avoid configuring many tools in an agent.
   2. Provide a detailed tool description to clarify what the tool can do. 
   3. Specify the tool to use in the LLM question, for example, `Can you use the PPLTool to query index opensearch_dashboards_sample_data_ecommerce to calculate how many orders there were during last week?`
   4. Specify the tool to use when executing an agent, 
   for example, tell the agent to only use the `PPLTool` and `CatIndexTool` in the current request.
   ```
   POST _plugins/_ml/agents/your_agent_id/_execute
   {
     "parameters": {
       "question": "Can you query with index opensearch_dashboards_sample_data_ecommerce to calculate how many orders in last week?",
       "verbose": false,
       "selected_tools": ["PPLTool", "CatIndexTool"]
     }
   }
   ```


#### 3.2.1 Test `PPLTool`
```
POST _plugins/_ml/agents/your_agent_id/_execute
{
  "parameters": {
    "question": "Can you query with index opensearch_dashboards_sample_data_ecommerce to calculate how many orders in last week?",
    "verbose": false
  }
}
```
Because you specified`"include_output_in_agent_response": true` for the `PPLTool`, the response contains `PPLTool.output` in the `additional_info` object.
```
{
  "inference_results": [
    {
      "output": [
        {
          "name": "memory_id",

        },
        {
          "name": "response",
          "dataAsMap": {
            "response": "The tool response from the PPLTool shows that there were 3812 orders in the opensearch_dashboards_sample_data_ecommerce index within the last week.",
            "additional_info": {
              "PPLTool.output": [
                """{"ppl":"source\u003dopensearch_dashboards_sample_data_ecommerce| where order_date \u003e DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 1 WEEK) | stats COUNT() AS count","executionResult":"{\n  \"schema\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"count\",\n      \"type\": \"integer\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"datarows\": [\n    [\n      3812\n    ]\n  ],\n  \"total\": 1,\n  \"size\": 1\n}"}"""
              ]
            }
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## 4. Agent with custom prompt (Optional)

If you don't need to customize the prompt, skip this step.

### 4.1 Default prompt
You can find the default prompt in the [PromptTemplate code](https://github.com/opensearch-project/ml-commons/blob/main/ml-algorithms/src/main/java/org/opensearch/ml/engine/algorithms/agent/PromptTemplate.java).

Default prompt: 
```
"prompt": """

Human:${parameters.prompt.prefix}

${parameters.prompt.suffix}

Human: follow RESPONSE FORMAT INSTRUCTIONS

Assistant:"""
```

The prompt consists of two parts:
1. `${parameters.prompt.prefix}`: Describes what AI Assistant can do. You can change this parameter based on your use case. For example `You are a professional data analyst. You will always answer question based on the tool response first. If you don't know the answer, just say you don't know.`
2. `${parameters.prompt.suffix}`: This is the main part that defines tools, chat history, prompt format instructions, a question, and a scratchpad. 

Default `prompt.suffix`:
```
"prompt.suffix": """Human:TOOLS
------
Assistant can ask Human to use tools to look up information that may be helpful in answering the users original question. The tool response will be listed in "TOOL RESPONSE of {tool name}:". If TOOL RESPONSE is enough to answer human's question, Assistant should avoid rerun the same tool. 
Assistant should NEVER suggest run a tool with same input if it's already in TOOL RESPONSE. 
The tools the human can use are:

${parameters.tool_descriptions}

${parameters.chat_history}

${parameters.prompt.format_instruction}


Human:USER'S INPUT
--------------------
Here is the user's input :
${parameters.question}

${parameters.scratchpad}"""
```

The `prompt.suffix` consists of the following placeholders:
1. `${parameters.tool_descriptions}`: This placeholder will be filled by the agent's tools' information: the tool name and description. If you remove this part, the agent will not use any tools.
2. `${parameters.prompt.format_instruction}`: This part defines the LLM response format. This is critical. We recommend not removing this part.
3. `${parameters.chat_history}`: This placeholder will be filled by the message history of the current memory. If you don't set the `memory_id` when you run the agent, or there are no history messages, this part will be empty. If you don't need chat history, you can remove this part.
4. `${parameters.question}`: This placeholder will be filled by your question.
5. `${parameters.scratchpad}`: This part will be filled with the detailed steps in agent execution. These steps are the same as those you can view by specifying verbose mode or obtaining trace data (see an example in step 3.2). This is critical for the LLM to reason and select the next step based on the outcome of the previous steps. We recommend not removing this part.

### 4.2 Examples with custom prompt
#### Example1: customize `prompt.prefix`
```
POST _plugins/_ml/agents/_register
{

{
  "parameters": {
    "question": "What's the stock price increase of Amazon from May 2023 to Feb 2023?",
    "verbose": true
  }
}
```

#### Example2: OpenAI model with custom prompt

Create a connector for the OpenAI "gpt-3.5-turbo" model:

```
POST _plugins/_ml/connectors/_create
{
  "name": "My openai connector: gpt-3.5-turbo",
  "description": "The connector to openai chat model",
  "version": 1,
  "protocol": "http",
  "parameters": {
    "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo",
    "response_filter": "$.choices[0].message.content",
    "stop": ["\n\nHuman:","\nObservation:","\n\tObservation:","\n\tObservation","\n\nQuestion"],
    "system_instruction": "You are an Assistant which can answer kinds of questions."
  },
  "credential": {
    "openAI_key": "your_openAI_key"
  },
  "actions": [
    {
      "action_type": "predict",
      "method": "POST",
      "url": "https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer ${credential.openAI_key}"
      },
      "request_body": "{ \"model\": \"${parameters.model}\", \"messages\": [{\"role\":\"system\",\"content\":\"${parameters.system_instruction}\"},{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"${parameters.prompt}\"}] }"
    }
  ]
}
```
Create a model using the connector ID from the response:
```
POST /_plugins/_ml/models/_register?deploy=true
{
    "name": "My OpenAI model",
    "function_name": "remote",
    "description": "test model",
    "connector_id": "your_connector_id"
}
```
Note the model ID and test the model by calling the Predict API:
```
POST /_plugins/_ml/models/your_openai_model_id/_predict
{
  "parameters": {
    "system_instruction": "You are an Assistant which can answer kinds of questions.",
    "prompt": "hello"
  }
}
```

Create an agent with custom `system_instruction` and `prompt`.

The `prompt` includes the following placeholders (for more information, see step 4.1): `tool_descriptions`, `chat_history`, `format_instruction`, `question`, and `scratchpad`.

```

Note the agent ID from the response and test the model by running the agent:
```
POST _plugins/_ml/agents/your_agent_id/_execute
{
  "parameters": {
    "question": "What's the stock price increase of Amazon from May 2023 to Feb 2023?",
    "verbose": true
  }
}
```

Test the agent by asking a question that requires the agent to use both configured tools:
```
POST _plugins/_ml/agents/your_agent_id/_execute
{
  "parameters": {
    "question": "What's the population increase of Seattle from 2021 to 2023? Then check what's the stock price increase of Amazon from May 2023 to Feb 2023?",
    "verbose": true
  }
}
```
The response shows that the agent runs both `population_data_knowledge_base` and `stock_price_data_knowledge_base` tools:

## 5. Configure root chatbot in OpenSearch Dashboard

For more information, see [OpenSearch Assistant documentation](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/ml-commons-plugin/opensearch-assistant/). 

OpenSearch 2.12 released an experimental chabot UI for OpenSearch Dashboards. To use it, first you need to configure a root chatbot agent.

A root chatbot agent consists of the following parts:
- `conversational` agent: Within the `AgentTool`, you can use any `conversational` agent created in the previous steps.
- `MLModelTool`: This tool is used for suggesting new questions based on your current question and the model response.

```

      "include_output_in_agent_response": true
    }
  ],
  "memory": {
    "type": "conversation_index"
  }
}
```
Note the root chatbot agent ID, then log in to your OpenSearch server, go to OpenSearch config folder `$OS_HOME/config` and run the following command:
```
 curl -k --cert ./kirk.pem --key ./kirk-key.pem -X PUT https://localhost:9200/.plugins-ml-config/_doc/os_chat -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d'
 {
   "type":"os_chat_root_agent",
   "configuration":{
     "agent_id": "your_root_chatbot_agent_id"
   }
 }'
```

Go to your OpenSearch Dashboards config folder, `$OSD_HOME/config`, edit `opensearch_dashboards.yml` by adding the following line to the end: `assistant.chat.enabled: true`.

Restart OpenSearch Dashboards, then select the chat icon, as shown in the following image.

You can now chat in OpenSearch Dashboards, as shown in the following image.
