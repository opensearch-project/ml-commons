> Agent Framework is GA released in OpenSearch 2.13. To read more details, see the OpenSearch document [Agents and tools](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/ml-commons-plugin/agents-tools/index/).

Read this AWS [retrieval-augmented-generation](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/retrieval-augmented-generation/) doc to learn more details about RAG.

One of the known limitations of large language models (LLMs) is that their knowledge base only contains information up to the time when the LLMs were trained. 
LLMs have no knowledge of recent events or your internal data. 
You can augment the LLM knowledge base by using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).

This tutorial explains how to build your own chatbot using the Agent Framework and RAG, supplementing the LLM knowledge with information contained in OpenSearch indexes.

Note: Replace the placeholders that start with `your_` with your own values.

# Steps

## 0. Preparation

Follow step 0 and step 1 of [RAG_with_conversational_flow_agent](./RAG_with_conversational_flow_agent.md) to set up
the `test_population_data` index to provide supplementary information to the LLM. The index contains population data of US cities.

Note the embedding model ID, which you'll use in the next steps. 

Create an ingest pipeline:
```
PUT /_ingest/pipeline/test_tech_news_pipeline
{
    "description": "text embedding pipeline for tech news",
    "processors": [
        {
            "text_embedding": {
                "model_id": "your_text_embedding_model_id",
                "field_map": {
                    "passage": "passage_embedding"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

Next, create another index named `test_tech_news`, which contains recent tech news:

```
PUT test_tech_news
{
  "mappings": {
    "properties": {
      "passage": {
        "type": "text"
      },
      "passage_embedding": {
        "type": "knn_vector",
        "dimension": 384
      }
    }
  },
  "settings": {
    "index": {
      "knn.space_type": "cosinesimil",
      "default_pipeline": "test_tech_news_pipeline",
      "knn": "true"
    }
  }
}
```

Ingest data. 
- The first two documents are from Wikipedia([Apple Vision Pro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Vision_Pro), [LLaMA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LLaMA)).
- The third one is from [Amazon Bedrock documentation](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/)

{"passage":"LLaMA (Large Language Model Meta AI) is a family of autoregressive large language models (LLMs), released by Meta AI starting in February 2023.\n\nFor the first version of LLaMA, four model sizes were trained: 7, 13, 33, and 65 billion parameters. LLaMA's developers reported that the 13B parameter model's performance on most NLP benchmarks exceeded that of the much larger GPT-3 (with 175B parameters) and that the largest model was competitive with state of the art models such as PaLM and Chinchilla.[1] Whereas the most powerful LLMs have generally been accessible only through limited APIs (if at all), Meta released LLaMA's model weights to the research community under a noncommercial license.[2] Within a week of LLaMA's release, its weights were leaked to the public on 4chan via BitTorrent.[3]\n\nIn July 2023, Meta released several models as Llama 2, using 7, 13 and 70 billion parameters.\n\nLLaMA-2\n\nOn July 18, 2023, in partnership with Microsoft, Meta announced LLaMA-2, the next generation of LLaMA. Meta trained and released LLaMA-2 in three model sizes: 7, 13, and 70 billion parameters.[4] The model architecture remains largely unchanged from that of LLaMA-1 models, but 40% more data was used to train the foundational models.[5] The accompanying preprint[5] also mentions a model with 34B parameters that might be released in the future upon satisfying safety targets.\n\nLLaMA-2 includes both foundational models and models fine-tuned for dialog, called LLaMA-2 Chat. In further departure from LLaMA-1, all models are released with weights, and are free for many commercial use cases. However, due to some remaining restrictions, the description of LLaMA as open source has been disputed by the Open Source Initiative (known for maintaining the Open Source Definition).[6]\n\nIn November 2023, research conducted by Patronus AI, an artificial intelligence startup company, compared performance of LLaMA-2, OpenAI's GPT-4 and GPT-4-Turbo, and Anthropic's Claude2 on two versions of a 150-question test about information in SEC filings (e.g. Form 10-K, Form 10-Q, Form 8-K, earnings reports, earnings call transcripts) submitted by public companies to the agency where one version of the test required the generative AI models to use a retrieval system to locate the specific SEC filing to answer the questions while the other version provided the specific SEC filing to the models to answer the question (i.e. in a long context window). On the retrieval system version, GPT-4-Turbo and LLaMA-2 both failed to produce correct answers to 81% of the questions, while on the long context window version, GPT-4-Turbo and Claude-2 failed to produce correct answers to 21% and 24% of the questions respectively.[7][8]"}

## 1. Create LLM

Follow step 2 (Prepare LLM) of [RAG_with_conversational_flow_agent](./RAG_with_conversational_flow_agent.md) to set up the Bedrock Claude model.

Note the model ID, you will use it in following steps.

## 2. Create Agent
Create an agent of the `conversational` type. 

Both `conversational_flow` and `conversational` agents support conversation history.

The `conversational_flow` and `conversational` agents differ in the following ways:
- `conversational_flow` agent runs tools sequentially, in a predefined order.
- `conversational` agent dynamically chooses which tool to run next.

In this tutorial, the agent includes two tools that provide recent population data and tech news.

Explanation:

- `"max_iteration": 5`: Agent runs the LLM a maximum of 5 times.
- `"response_filter": "$.completion"` is to retrieve the LLM answer from the Bedrock Claude model response.
- `"doc_size": 3` (in `population_data_knowledge_base`) specifies to return the top 3 documents.
```

      }
    }
  ],
  "app_type": "chat_with_rag"
}
```
Note the agent ID; you will use it in the next step.

## 3. Test Agent

The `conversational` agent supports a `verbose` option. You can set `verbose` to `true` to obtain detailed steps.

Alternatively, you can use the Get Trace Data API:
```
GET _plugins/_ml/memory/message/message_id/traces
```

### 3.1 Start new conversation
- Example 1: Ask a question related to tech news:
```
POST _plugins/_ml/agents/your_agent_id/_execute
{
  "parameters": {
    "question": "What's vision pro",
    "verbose": true
  }
}
```
In the response, note that the agent runs the `tech_news_knowledge_base` tool to obtain the top 2 documents. The agent then passes these documents as context to the LLM.
The LLM uses the context to answer the question correctly.
